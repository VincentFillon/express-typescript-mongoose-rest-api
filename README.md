------------------------------------

## ❯ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install yarn globally

```bash
yarn global add yarn
```

Install a MySQL database.

> If you work with a mac, we recommend to use homebrew for the installation.

### Step 2: Create new Project

Fork or download this project. Configure your package.json for your new project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you have to add your database connection information and your superadmin access credentials.

Create a new database with the name you have in your `.env` file.

Then setup your application environment.

```bash
yarn run setup
```

> This installs all dependencies with yarn. In this version, the installation and automatic integration of datas in the database is not yet managed. It will come soon ! Therefore, you can run the command `yarn run install` instead of `yarn run setup`

### Step 3: Serve your App

Go to the project dir and start your app with this yarn script.

```bash
yarn start serve
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the server according to these changes.
> The server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

------------------------------------

## ❯ Scripts and Tasks

All script are defined in the `package-scripts.js` file, but the most important ones are listed here.

### Install

- Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting

- Run code quality analysis using `yarn start lint`. This runs tslint.
- There is also a vscode task for this called `lint`.

### Tests

- Run the unit tests using `yarn start test` (There is also a vscode task for this called `test`).
- Run the e2e tests using `yarn start test.e2e`.

### Running in dev mode

- Run `yarn start serve` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.
- The server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`

### Building the project and run it

- Run `yarn start build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources (There is also a vscode task for this called `build`).
- To start the builded app located in `dist` use `yarn start`.

------------------------------------

## ❯ Debugger in VSCode

To debug your code run `yarn start build` or hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> to build your app.
Then, just set a breakpoint and hit <kbd>F5</kbd> in your Visual Studio Code.

------------------------------------

## ❯ API Routes

The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file.
The swagger and the monitor route can be altered in the `.env` file.

| Route             | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| **/api**          | Shows us the name, description and the version of the package.json |
| **/swagger**      | This is the Swagger UI with our API documentation |
| **/monitor**      | Shows a small monitor page for the server |
| **/api/users**    | Example entity endpoint |
| **/api/groups**   | Example entity endpoint |
| **/api/pools**    | Example entity endpoint |

------------------------------------

## ❯ Logging

Our logger is [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). To log http request we use the express middleware [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan).
We created a simple annotation to inject the logger in your service (see example below).

```typescript
import { Logger, LoggerInterface } from '../../decorators/Logger';

@Service()
export class UserService {

    constructor(
        @Logger(__filename) private log: LoggerInterface
    ) { }

    ...
```

------------------------------------

## ❯ Event Dispatching

We use this awesome repository [event-dispatch](https://github.com/pleerock/event-dispatch) for event dispatching.
We created a simple annotation to inject the EventDispatcher in your service (see example below). All events are listed in the `events.ts` file.

```typescript
import { events } from '../subscribers/events';
import { EventDispatcher, EventDispatcherInterface } from '../../decorators/EventDispatcher';

@Service()
export class UserService {

    constructor(
        @EventDispatcher() private eventDispatcher: EventDispatcherInterface
    ) { }

    public async create(user: User): Promise<User> {
        ...
        this.eventDispatcher.dispatch(events.user.created, newUser);
        ...
    }
```

## ❯ Docker

### Install Docker

Before you start, make sure you have a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed

### Build Docker image

```shell
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```

### Run Docker image in container and map port

The port which runs your application inside Docker container is either configured as `PORT` property in your `.env` configuration file or passed to Docker container via environment variable `PORT`. Default port is `3000`.

#### Run image in detached mode

```shell
docker run -d -p <port-on-host>:<port-inside-docker-container> <your-image-name>
```

#### Run image in foreground mode

```shell
docker run -i -t -p <port-on-host>:<port-inside-docker-container> <your-image-name>
```

### Stop Docker container

#### Detached mode

```shell
docker stop <container-id>
```

You can get a list of all running Docker container and its ids by following command

```shell
docker images
```

#### Foreground mode

Go to console and press <CTRL> + C at any time.

### Docker environment variables

There are several options to configure your app inside a Docker container

#### project .env file

You can use `.env` file in project root folder which will be copied inside Docker image. If you want to change a property inside `.env` you have to rebuild your Docker image.

#### run options

You can also change app configuration by passing environment variables via `docker run` option `-e` or `--env`.

```shell
docker run --env DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_PORT=3306
```

#### environment file

Last but not least you can pass a config file to `docker run`.

```shell
docker run --env-file ./env.list
```

`env.list` example:

```
# this is a comment
DB_HOST=my_docker_localhost
DB_PORT=my_docker_port
DB_USERNAME=my_docker_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=my_docker_db_password
DB_DATABASE=my_docker_db_name
```
